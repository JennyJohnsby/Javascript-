// 1.If else statement â€“ comparison operators

// Note - Start by defining the variables you need. Write the code underneath each exercise

/*
    1.1) Write a if else statement to compare two numbers (any numbers) and console log
         which one is larger, or if they are equal. Use the > and === operator

*/

// insert code below:

/*
    1.2) Modify your statement from Exercise 1.1 to compare three numbers and console log the
         largest one. Use the >, || (OR), and && (AND) operators to combine conditions.
*/

// insert code below:

/*

    1.3) Write a JavaScript program that checks if a number is within a given range.
         The range is 10 to 50 inclusive. Use the >= and <= operators.
         Console.log a message indicating whether the number is within the range.

*/

// insert code below:

/*
    1.4) JavaScript has two types of equality operators: == (loose equality) and
         === (strict equality). Write an if else statement that compares two values with both operators
         and log out a message to console explaining if they are "loosely" or
         "strictly" equal, or not equal at all. Use different data types for the comparison to
         see how type coercion works with ==.
*/

/*
    1.5) Write an if else statement that checks if two values are not equal, using both the != (loose not-equal)
         and !== (strict not-equal) operators. First, compare two numbers that are not equal. Then, compare a number
         and a string that wouldn't be equal strictly but would be considered equal with type coercion. Explain the
         outcome with comments or print statements.

*/

/*
    1.6) Create a more complex program that involves multiple variables and logical conditions. Suppose you have three
         variables: age, driverLicense, and visionGood. Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to drive.
         The conditions are:

        They must be 18 years or older.
        They must have a driver's license (driverLicense should be true).
        Their vision must be good (visionGood should be true).
